### Getting started
The project has been primarily built for the universal Windows platform (UWP), so you'll need the latest version of [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (including the community edition) and the latest Windows 10 SDK which you can install as part of the Visual Studio installer.

I'm using github packages from my toolkit for nuget, to restore them in VS you need to add this,
go to tools -> options -> nuget package manager -> package sources
Name: Github (or whatever)
Source: https://nuget.pkg.github.com/emiliano84/index.json

when VS will ask for credentials
